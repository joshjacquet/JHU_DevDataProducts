# Instructions for Cars Exploration Shiny App

This Shiny app is simple. It is designed to do a few explorations of the *mtcars* dataset, and meets the requirements for the Week 4 project of Developing Data Products through Coursera.

Again - very simple. On the next page, you will select as many or as few car makes as you'd like. There are two plots and a table for you to review, which provide some visual representations of the relationship between horsepower and miles per hour, as well as the number of cars by horsepower range in a histogram.

Enjoy.
